Helpful tools for bulk Lego sets

***********************************************
**** LEGO SET INVENTORY TOOL
***********************************************
Description:
    This tool was designed to help sort out pieces for a specific set from a large quantity of bulk Lego. Allows users to input a Lego set number to retrieve a parts inventory from Rebrickable. Pictures of parts are displayed in a grid along with current/required amounts. Once the required quantity for a part is reached the part is removed from the grid to declutter. Amounts are automatically saved to a csv file adjacent to the script in the form <Lego Set Name>.csv. Parts still needed can be exported to Bricklink format so they can be bought with ease.
